# Ocean Heartbeat Audio Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the ocean heartbeat audio file.

To add the actual audio:
1. Download or create a short looping ocean heartbeat sound (MP3 format)
2. Rename it to `ocean_heartbeat.mp3`
3. Place it in the `public/` directory
4. The audio will automatically play in the background

The audio should be:
- Short (10-30 seconds)
- Looping
- Subtle ambient sound
- Ocean-themed (waves, heartbeat, etc.)
- Low volume to not interfere with the experience
